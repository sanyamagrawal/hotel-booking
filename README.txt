Here is the list of Task based on the priority and the reason for me choosing this way

*  Improve the hotel page however you see fit. (PRIORITY 1)
    -- This task is most important because this is the place where user will see all the information.
    -- This page should be designed based on the face that users have come to get more information about the hotel.
    -- A responsive page ideally means it can be rendered in more browsers of different sized resulting in more target audience, More customer and more page views.

*  Improve the facilities block. (PRIORITY 2)
    -- A user searching on booking.com needs to get details about the hotel and various other informationâ€™s about the hotel. The more detail a user can provide the better it is. This section should contain both the amenities and the descriptions. Basically a snapshot detail of the entire hotel , letting user know we mean to keep Crisp and clear information.

*    Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails currently in the page. Some ideas you may consider: include an automatic slideshow mode, add prev/next buttons to manually control the carousel, and add a layer that shows the contents of the images alt text. (PRIORITY 3)

    -- Once a user has seen and details of the hotel. He would be interested in seeing how the hotel looks and the view of the hotel. This is really important as picture speaks louder the words. People can relate more by a look then by reading. But this is kept below the facilities block because a pic cannot describe the facilities provided.

 *  Imagine there's a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one. Design the JSON format and use it to display similar   hotels on the page. (PRIORITY 4)
    -- Relevance: The more a customer engages with the product, he/she becomes a return user.
        If a business can improve their time on site, it generally signals high interest in the product, more page views, and increased ad revenue (if applicable).


*  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user to sort the reviews by review score.(PRIORITY 5)
    -- Reviews take up lot of customer time and star rating or the no of views itself can help a lot. Top reviews can be a section of its own but people generally read top 1 or 2 reviews and can be added as part of the amenities and description.


*  Improve the room table. Some ideas you may consider: allow the user to sort
    the rooms table by occupancy or price, display a total when the user selects a quantity, display additional information about rooms.(PRIORITY 6)

 *  Imagine there's a JSON feed with nearby landmarks. Design the JSON format  and use it to display landmarks on the page.(PRIORITY 7)
